A Configuration Management System (CMS) is a set of tools and processes used to automate and manage the configuration of IT infrastructure, ensuring consistency, stability, and efficiency across systems.

## Key Features of a Configuration Management System:

1. Automation – Automates repetitive tasks like installing software, configuring servers, and managing dependencies.
2. Version Control – Tracks changes in configurations, allowing rollback if needed.
3. Consistency – Ensures that all systems have the same configurations, reducing errors and mismatches.
4. Scalability – Can manage thousands of servers or devices without manual intervention.
5. Compliance & Security – Helps enforce security policies and compliance standards.

## Popular Configuration Management Tools:

1. Ansible – Agentless, uses SSH for automation.
2. Puppet – Uses declarative language, good for large infrastructures.
3. hef – Uses Ruby-based DSL, ideal for complex automation.
4. SaltStack – Fast and scalable, uses a master-minion architecture.
