# Why Use Passwordless Authentication in Ansible

1. **Automation Without Interruption:**  
   Ansible is designed to run tasks automatically across many remote hosts. If you had to enter a password each time, it would halt the automation process. Passwordless authentication allows Ansible to connect to remote systems non-interactively, which is crucial for running batch jobs or scheduled tasks without manual intervention.

2. **Enhanced Security:**  
   Using SSH key-based authentication (a common method for passwordless login) is more secure than using plain text passwords. With keys, you avoid transmitting or storing passwords, which reduces the risk of them being intercepted or compromised. It also allows you to enforce more stringent access controls (like using passphrases for keys and restricting key usage to specific commands or hosts).

3. **Scalability:**  
   In environments with a large number of servers, entering or managing passwords for every host is impractical. Passwordless authentication simplifies scaling your infrastructure since the authentication mechanism works uniformly across all nodes, making the process faster and less error-prone.

4. **Consistency and Reliability:**  
   When every connection to a remote host is made using SSH keys (or another form of passwordless authentication), you ensure that the authentication method is consistent. This uniformity helps in maintaining reliability in your automation workflows, as all nodes follow the same authentication procedure.


Ansible supports two primary methods for establishing SSH connections to remote hosts: **SSH key-based authentication** and **SSH password-based authentication**. Below is a detailed explanation of each method:

## 1. SSH Key-Based Authentication

**Overview:**  
- Uses a public/private key pair for authentication.
- The public key is stored on the remote host in the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
- The private key remains securely on the control node (where Ansible is executed).

**Advantages:**  
- **Passwordless Automation:**  
  Enables non-interactive, automated connections without requiring manual password entry.
- **Enhanced Security:**  
  Less vulnerable to brute-force attacks. The private key can be encrypted with a passphrase for extra security.
- **Scalability:**  
  Easily scales across many hosts as the same key pair can be distributed, avoiding the need to manage individual passwords.

**Syntax:**

``` 
ssh-copy-id -f -o IndentityFile=<Add they path of they key> ubuntu@<Add they ip address>
```

 or using 

 ```
 ssh-copy-id -i ~/keys/keys.pub ubuntu@98.81.59.209
```

### if its ask they publickey:

```
chmod 600 <key path> 
```

### is used to generate the public key from your private key.
```
ssh-keygen -y -f /home/suzil/keys/keys.pem  >/home/suzil/keys/keys.pub 
```




# Inventory 

Ansible inventory file is a fundamental component of Ansible that defines the hosts (remote systems) that you want to manage and the groups those hosts belong to. The inventory file can be static (a simple text file) or dynamic (generated by a script). It provides Ansible with the information about the remote nodes to communicate with during its operations.

## Static Inventory

A static inventory file is typically a plain text file (usually named hosts or inventory) and is structured in INI or YAML format. Here are examples of both formats:

### INI Format

```
# inventory file: hosts

[webservers]
web1.example.com
web2.example.com

[dbservers]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com

[all:vars]
ansible_user=admin
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/path/to/key
```

### YAML

```
# inventory file: hosts.yaml

all:
  vars:
    ansible_user: admin
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: /path/to/key
  children:
    webservers:
      hosts:
        web1.example.com:
        web2.example.com:
    dbservers:
      hosts:
        db1.example.com:
        db2.example.com:
```

## Usage

To create they ini file 

```
 vim inventory.ini
```

```
ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all <--key-file if ask for they path we need to mention> 
```
 
 ### if we want to install or update any tools or modules: 

 ```
 ansible -i inventory.ini all <--key-file if ask for they path we need to mention> --become -a "apt update && apt install <module name>"
 ```
In two ways we can write a ansible commmands:

1. **ad hoc commmands** - we use they ad hoc commmands for they simple process for example (restart,shutdown,install,update) 
2. **ansible playbook** - we use they ansible playbook for they complex task for exaple (docker-- we need more dependence so we use they ansible playbook)
